* You may have enemies like creatures, machines, warriors, etc.

* You may have items like swords, guns, armor, space-suits, etc.

* You may have skills like double-damage, teleportation, etc.

General Requirements

Please define and implement the following object-oriented assets in your project:

* At least 5 interfaces (with one or more implementations)

* At least 15 classes (implementing the application logic)

* At least 3 abstract class (with inheritors)

* At least 1 exception class (with usage in your code)

* At least 3 levels of depth in inheritance

* At least 1 polymorphism usage

* At least 1 structure

* At least 1 enumeration

* At least 1 event (with subscribers)

* At least 1 design pattern (e.g. Composite, Singleton, Factory, Wrapper, Bridge, Command, Iterator, …) You might read about design patterns in Wikipedia, Sourcemaking, DoFactory and others.

Additional Requirements

* Follow the best practices for OO design: use data encapsulation, use exception handling properly, use delegates and events like it is recommended in MSDN, use inheritance, abstraction and polymorphism properly, follow the principles of strong cohesion and loose coupling.

* Obligatory use Git to keep your source code and for team collaboration (you might use https://github.com/). TFS or SVN are not allowed. Use Git.

* Provide a class diagram (to visualize all types).

Optional Requirements

If you have a chance, time and a suitable situation, you might add some of the following to your project:

* Static members (fields, properties, constructor, etc.)

* Constants, generic types, indexers, operators

* Lambda expressions and LINQ

* Implementation of IEnumerable<T>, ICloneable, ToString() override

* Namespaces (if your classes are too much)
